# Python studies
============

Yes, Yes. Yet another new year resolution if you want to call it that. It's just about time for me to get acclimated to Python.
I find python being quite a nice language but I never coded any real application, so this is the beginnings.

## Extra
The list below is to count the days I'm coding in python but not in this repository.

### day 13
Started a simple python app hosted on Heroku to sale my motorcycle

### Day 17
Migrating solshal.com scrapping stack from JS (Scraperjs) to a service where I'm using Python (Scrapy)

### Day 18
After some experimentation and research I have decided that Scrapy is much more robust than what I need, now I'm experimenting with BeautifulSoup4 and seems like that's what I'm going with for now
